CSIP: Canadiana.org TDR SIP Technical Specification (v. 0.3)
http://canadiana.ca/schema/2012/txt/sip.txt


Abstract

    This document describes the technical specification for the
    Canadiana.org Trustworthy Digital Repository (TDR) Submission Information
    Package (SIP). Sumbissions to the TDR must meet all of the SIP
    requirements described here in order to be accepted for ingest.


Status

    This is a working draft and is subject to change. The finalized
    specification will be given the version number 1.0. The specification
    may be extended from time to time to include additional features, such
    as support for additional descriptive metadata formats or an expanded
    range of digital object types.


Purpose

    CSIP is the standard SIP format for submitting digital content into
    the Canadiana TDR.


Scope

    Each SIP contains metadata and digital assets associated with a single
    digital object. Three types of objects are supported:

    Documents are printed material. They may contain
    individually-accessible pages or other sub-parts, each represented by
    different digital resources, or they may consist of a single resource.
    The standard document object is a book or similar paged item, but the
    definition is broad enough to include maps, photographs, posters, or
    other printed material, so long as it meets the general form
    requirements.

    Series are metadata-only objects which describe a collection of
    documents. A series can be any sort of ordered collection of
    documents, such as a periodical, monographic series, or collection of
    photographs.

    Issues are documents which belong to a series. They differ from
    standard documents in the metadata standards used to describe them and
    in the fact that they are linked to a series object. All issues
    submitted to the TDR should be associated with a valid series in order
    to provide the proper metadata and context for the issue.


Standards

    The following standards and schemas are used within CSIP:

    BagIt v.0.97: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-07
    METS 1.9.1: http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/
    CSIP METS Profile: http://www.canadiana.ca/schema/2012/mets/csip
    MARCXML: http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/
    Simple Dublin Core: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
    issueinfo: http://www.canadiana.ca/schema/2012/xsd/issueinfo
    txtmap: http://www.canadiana.ca/schema/2012/xsd/txtmap


Structure

    A valid CSIP is a BagIt version 0.97 archive. The BagIt root must
    contain a bagit.txt file with the correct declaration and a
    manifest-md5.txt file containing MD5 hex digest checksums of all of
    the files in the payload. Payload files may be included in the data
    directory and/or specified in a fetch.txt file. All other files in the
    bagit root are optional.

    The payload consists of one required file called 'metadata.xml' and
    two optional subdirectories called 'metadata' and 'files'

    The metadata.txt file is a METS version 1.9.1 record which conforms to
    the Canadiana Submission Information Package (CSIP) METS profile. The
    CSIP profile specifies additional constraints on the content of the
    archive, including required digital asset files and file naming
    conventions.

    The files directory must contain all digital assets referenced in
    <FLocat> elements within the METS document.

    The metadata firectory must contain all metadata files referenced by
    <mdRef> elements within the METS document.


Validity

    A CSIP submission is considered valid if it meets all of the
    requirements described in this document, including all of the
    requirements of the CSIP METS profile. Invalid submissions will not be
    accepted for ingest into the Canadiana TDR.
