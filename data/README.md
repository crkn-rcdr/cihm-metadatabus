# Side-loaded data

There is data for a few projects that didn't fit into our data model at the time.  We created a mechanism to side-load the data.

## Parliament of Canada

The parl/ folder contains extra data needed for the browse tree for https://parl.canadiana.ca/

## Heritage Premium

The tag/ folder contains extra data created for the Heritage Premium project. 
All the data at https://heritage.canadiana.ca/ is now [available at no charge](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/over-60-million-pages-digitized-canadian-documentary-heritage-soon-be-available-no-charge).
