Continuing the narrative from the 22nd. On evening of 22nd, reports from Niagara District mere so grove that he decided on active measures. He Issued a proclamation, a copy of which is enclosed, and proceeded to call out the sedentary militia. Learning that rebels were inciting Indians to rise, beat once set them in motion. At Niagara he found the greatest excitement and alarm. Rumours were flying about as to large numbers already landed in Canada and much larger numbers awaiting, an opportunity on United States side. A prisoner stated that banditti in province were led by a Colonel Morreau, an American, who had issued a proclamation, a copy of which was enclosed. Reward of Â£500 offered for Morreau's apprehension. A gentleman bearing testimonial from Governor of New York gave much information as to activities on American side. To make display of force, and decide the waverers, Arthur proceeded into disaffected district with party of Queen's Lancers. Result very satisfactory. Between 30 and 40 captured, including Morreau, Wait, a Canadian, second in command and bearing Flag of Liberty, Dr. Wilson, who had escaped in previous winter in fact all the leaders. Numbers reported as having entered Canada apparently greatly exaggerated, though it is difficult to ascertain truth. At Niagara, Arthur had most satisfactory interview with Major Young in command of American Regulars, and General Burt of New York Militia. Young, active and of good faith, but hampered by lack of sufficient troops. Arthur was assured that better class of Americans had no sympathy with rebels, but that country near lakes was overrun by ungovernable mass of lowest class. Young has authority to employ one or two steamers to guard their shore, and he himself has vessels cruising near Amherstburg. As to manner of dealing with prisoners, loyal part of population greatly exaggerated by outrages to which they have been subjected, and they expect all prisoners will be immediately put on trial before Military Tribunal under Provincial Act. This act was designed to provide a means for trying citizens or subjects of foreign states entering province and committing acts of hostility. Although Canadians joining them may be tried by Military Tribunal, he prefers to have them tried by Courts for High Treason. Is much embarrassed by opinion of English Law Officers, in case of Theller, which states incidentally that his American associates were guilty of high treason. Legal opinion in Upper Canada entirely opposed to this view, and he is inclined to accept advice of his law officers. Their opinion is that persons hereto for owing no allegiance to the Queen, did not come under the obligation of temporary allegiance so as to be capable of committing high treason.Hence necessity for Provincial act mentioned. if judges do not agree with English Law Officers, American prisoners tried high treason might go free. He is convinced that punishment of most exemplary kind is imperatively called for. American authorities might otherwise reflect on slackness of Canadians. His satisfaction with Durham's proclamation. Recognizing popular objections to military tribunals, the course he purposes following is to indict British subjects for high treason, and foreigners for felony under Provincial Act. Has ordered special Commission of Oyer and Terminer for Niagara District. His anxiety is to reconcile merciful views of Government in England with feelings of people in province. Uncommon firmness required on part of militia officers to prevent their men from putting banditti to death on the spot. Looks to Durham advice and counsel-to what extent should capital punishment be carried? Government in England so intent on mercy to rebels that they scarcely approve of execution of Lount and Matthews, although they were guilty not only of high treason but of murder and arson as well. Theller bombarded Amherstburg and yet it seems doubtful whether Glenelg would approve of his execution. He himself has been strongly inclined to mercy, but in his opinion, if judicious and proper measures had been adopted by his predecessor, the insurrection would not have taken place-the policy that was pursued had a tendency to mislead, it was not justifiable to be inactive. Rolph, Mackenzie, Lount, Matthews and other leaders were justly chargeable, but many were misled by Government's want of activity. This excuse does not avail with perpetrators of present misdeeds. Everybody both in Canada and United States, must know what is done for defence of Province. His opinion is that 4 or 5 of the 40 taken should be executed, and the rest, in whose case nothing favourable can be found, sent to England for transportation to penal colonies."],"tagDate":["1938-06-27T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagPerson":["Arthur","Durham"]},"420":{"tagPerson":["Chapman","Arthur","FitzRoy","Fox","Durham"],"tagDate":["1838-08-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagDescription":["Enclosures: (2) Separate.

These men mere bulwark against Republican institutions; by their assistance, Head was able to overthrow the disaffected group, of which Mackenzie, Bidwell and Rolph were leaders. His instructions before he left London were that he should pursue the policy and measures of Head. With experience, however, he has seen reason For acting upon these to very limited extent. Buchanan's recommendations had a directly opposite tendency, and, if he had followed them, he would have given offence to the constitutional and most powerful section of community. Owing to disaffection, he has avoided controversial subjects. The only one he discussed was that of Clergy Reserves. Has intimated intention of bringing in bill to re-invest these lands in Crown. He has identified himself with no party, but has seen enough to convince him Buchanan's advice was not well-founded, and that his meddling at this time is mischievous. Buchanan has been imparting his views to Glenelg. Had an interview with Buchanan a day or two before. Buchanan dealt wholly in generalities, has no specific facts. On Head's reaching New York, Buchanan urged same arguments with him and successfully, the result being that Baldwin, brother of Buchanan's son-in-law, and some other Reformers were admitted to Executive Council. The ultimate consequence of this was the rebellion. Buchanan mentioned Chief Justice as head of Family Compact. Robinson stands highest for integrity and ability in estimation of all men of all parties. Buchanan overlooks struggle Family Compact has long maintained against measures lending to Republicanism. Americans and many Canadians have looked upon annexation as inevitable. Durham's arrival and late measures of Government in England have discouraged this view.

Chief embarrassments have arisen from hostility between Assemblies and Councils, and the collisions have been attributed justly or unjustly, to High Church and High Tory proclivities of latter. Hence he inclines to think that extinction of Legislative Councils would be regarded with satisfaction by Assemblies. In New Brunswick these conditions do not exist. Legislative Council sufficiently liberal to co-operate heartily with Assembly, and their dissolution would be regarded with disfavor by masses of people. General indisposition in province against connection with French Canada, and reluctance to surrender to any other body the control of any portion of its revenues, to the full possession of which they have so recently succeeded. Considers plan of legislative union should be at first confined to the two Canadas, the other provinces being kept free to join when they recognize benefits of union. This may not be at a very remote period. New Brunswick entirely satisfied with present position of affairs. With regard to suggestion of a Provincial Council of advice and opinion, that is precisely the machinery through which he is operating so satisfactorily.

Protesting against Durham's course in interfering with the right and duty of the Lieutenant Governor must take into account the feeling of the Legislative bodies with whom he must act. They would look sharply into any innovations upon the constitution of the province. He informed Durham of his having respited Chandler and Wait. Reviews the terms of his separate despatch from Cornwall, and indulged the, hope that Durham would withdraw the instruction, when he recognized that it. implied want of confidence in him, and would prejudice him in removing from him the prerogative of mercy. Durham's despatch (No. 8) dissipated this expectation, and he laid the despatches before the Executive Council, along with Mr. Justice Jones' report on the trials at Niagara. After careful consideration the Council drew up their opinion and embodied it in the Minute which he transmits. The sentences on all the prisoners are suspended until October 1, to enable Durham to consider the cases. He had suggested to Glenelg that he should have unfettered discretion as regards pardons. When he wrote to Glenelg, he was not acting under Durham's commission, which enables Lieutenant Governor, in Governor General's absence, to pardon even in cases of treason, and because the Provincial Act which received Royal approval authorized Lieutenant Governor to extend mercy only with advice of Executive Council; and the Council whose anxiety to do their duty, in justice towards the country, and in mercy towards the prisoners cannot be too highly commended, could not bring themselves to advise any further extension of clemency. He is anxious that as far as possible his proceedings should be supported by Council. He has made it, his endeavour to reconcile public mind to as wide an extension of mercy as possible, and where applications for pardons have been received, he has recommended that the interposition of respectable and loyal persons should be procured in order to warrant Government in extending clemency. On Receipt of Glenelg's despatch (No. 111) of July 12, he directed Council to review the cases again; and he himself visited the gaols in the eastern part of the Province to hear what prisoners could urge in their pleas for mercy. His effort is to find way of giving effect to the wishes of the Government in England without occasion for strong remonstrances or dissatisfaction on province. Assumes Durham does not desire to restrict his powers of action in dealing with the prisoners respecting which he has the distinct authority of Secretary of State. Asks Durham to observe that, even if he is mistaken in the view he has formed of Glenelg's despatch, the expressions of that despatch may lead themselves to that view."],"tagDate":["1838-08-29T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagPerson":["Arthur","Durham"]},"497":{"tagPerson":["Durham","Harvey"],"tagDate":["1838-07-16T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagDescription":["A.L.S.

Loyalists rights, that is, claims of children of Loyalists; (2) claims of members of volunteer companies first embodied during War of 1812; (3) claims of persons who emigrated from Scotland about 1815, under certain conditions; (4) claims of Naval and Military officers who can obtain locations on Crown Lands, which are put up to auction but remain unsold. Claims under first two heads understood to be still numerous. These may be located in certain specified townships. Little land remains unlocated in these townships, unless of inferior quality. Part of this land has been taken by persons weary of delay, who await more advantageous locations in new townships.

Glad to learn that time was shortly at hand when mercy may be extended without risk of remonstrance or discontent. I agree with you that this reduction (in number of persons marked for transportation) should in appearance as well as in reality originate rather with the Provincial than with the Home Government. Arthur is given authority to relieve from the sentence of Transportation, and from the inferior penalties of Banishment, Imprisonment or Confiscation, any persons whom you may think worthy of that indulgence-not as reversing wrong judgments, but as acting upon information which who Executive Council did not possess, and upon views to which the legal tribunals could not advert.

Salutary results of execution of Lount and Matthews. Nature and activities of Commission of Enquiry: functions no wider than ordinary justices of peace: appointed to ensure the utmost possible prudent, uniform and dispassionate course in preliminary proceedings; confusion that reigned when rebellion broke out, all the officers of government, the functionaries of justice, and loyal inhabitants, were actually soldiers under arms; many proceedings necessarily lacked legal warrant, particularly in matter of arrest; when Commission was appointed, number of arrests were so great that it was unsafe to keep all in confinement; first duty of Commission was to limit number of arrests, and next to arrange for discharge of least deeply implicated; in latter case, Commission, perhaps without strict legal authority, discharged upon bail to keep peace for one year many who were on confession guilty of high treason; in more serious cases took bail to appear at next court, and other were dismissed in default of evidence. Many persons still at large who reliable to arrest unless Executive Government intervenes. Request for power to pardon for high treason and to issue proclamations of amnesty, at least during existing crisis. Government in England too remote to deal properly with variety of cases; where lieutenant governor necessarily transcends his power in these circumstances, he must be supported solemnly and formally by Government in England. Asks approval of Order in Council, prescribing course towards persons charged with treason. Transmits report of Commission of Enquiry as to prisoners in Home District. Council in considering report had in view the extending of mercy to utmost limits consistent with public safety. He concurred in Council's recommendation in favour of permission of forfeiture of property and other disabilities on case of prisoners petitioning. If re-grant of property in such cases is legally necessary, if should be done under Provincial Act; but hopes it will not be necessary. As to cases calling for simple banishment, this is objectionable and dangerous if applied to many people having connections in Canada. Will confine this punishment almost entirely to Americans without connections in this country. Those guilty of petty outrages in course of rebellion get terms in penitentiary added to banishment. Much difficulty in providing punishment, short of death, for persons too deeply implicated to allowed at large. After discussion of all means, transportation to penal colony decided upon. Objections of Government in England to Extensive application of this punishment made known to Council, and latter were asked to go over list of those condemned thereto and reduce it to narrowest limits. This has been done. Tribute to members of Council. I never met with gentlemen more disposed to do their duty with moderation and firmness. Hopes Government in England will accept this list.

Concern that Durham should attribute to him an absence of perfect co-operation with Durham. He is actuated by entirely opposite spirit from that imagined by Durham. Explains the course pursued between the desire to extend clemency to utmost limits, and the necessity of exemplary punishment, coupled with the public indignation as to undue leniency towards those from whom they had suffered. His steady endeavour has been to bring over public mind to regard with some complacency the lenient dealings which the Home Government have pressed upon him. Disappointment on receiving Durham's despatch regarding Chandler and Wait. His despatches to Durham were dealt with when they met together in Toronto, and at that time he could not discover the slightest difference of opinion between them, except that Durham thought that offenders should have been more promptly brought to trial. Arthur insists that he thought he was acting in concert with Durham so far as the latter's sentiments could be discerned from his answers to addresses, his public declarations and from the personal communications between them. Durham's view that the power of pardon, which the Lieutenant Governor exercises, in absence of Governor General, is a delegated power, subject in its exercise to the general subordination to instructions from the Governor General, is not in accordance with his own instructions in Glenelg's despatch (No. 111). He is not struggling to a position of equality with Durham, but, in his humbler sphere, he has his duty to perform. He is ready to follow any general instructions he receives from Durham, but the considerations of, and decision upon, particular cases of crime and the exercise of pardoning power in such cases devolve upon him as officer administering government of province. He corrects a misapprehension of Durham's that, in selecting cases for capital punishment, he made an arbitrary choice, instead of picking out the most guilty.

It was resolved not to resort to suspension, and, by prudent management, when Rebellion broke out in December, it had Â£140,000 in specie in vaults, and only Â£80,000 of notes in circulation. Sudden demands on Commissary General which he was unable to meet, and although his account was overdrawn, Bank advanced him Â£50,000, leaving Â£90,000 in vaults. Subsequent advances took place-Â£34,417 in January, Â£96,618 in February and Â£88,892 in March-by which means the issue of notes had increased to Â£154,000 and specie in vaults reduced to Â£60,000. The Probability of Continuance of these demands coupled with the impracticability of getting specie from New York, and the depletion of the specie reserve by action of Commercial and other suspended banks, who, taking advantage of the great issue made for Government, collected notes of the Bank in large sums and demanded their redemption in specie, refusing to take their own notes in exchange, compelled directors to petition for leave to suspend which was immediately granted. Commissary General concurred as of means of carrying on the service until he could receive specie from abroad at the opening of navigation. Commissary General was also aware that the extraordinary issues were based on his Treasury Bills to amount of more than Â£200,000 sterling. Bank consequently suspended specie payment with Â£60,000 in gold and silver in vaults, and upwards of Â£200,000 sterling in London against Â£154,000 of its notes in province. Bank still pays troops, staff and departments, and, where required, contractors also in dollars. The opinion of the Bank of Upper Canada and Gore Bank on question of resumption (the Commercial Bank having declined to participate) is, that its immediate effect, owning to distressed condition of country, would be to compel Banks to stop all further discount and call in their debts. Actions at law to recover funds would be ineffective as sheriffs' sales would not to realize one-third value of goods or real estate. In stopping discount the advantage from large crop of wheat would be paralyzed, and country further drained of specie by farmers selling off and going to United States. It would be inadvisable to require resumption until crops brought to market. On the question of putting the currency of two provinces on equal footing, the first thing necessary is the abolition in Lower Canada of French half-crown as legal tender. It Passes for 2 shillings and ninepence, while its intrinsic value is no more than 1-10Â½d, or 2 shillings. It is not recognized as coin in any country except Lower Canada. The base copper coinage should be prohibited from circulation and replaced by Provincial coinage of good copper. Silver coinage should be established for colonies consisting of dollars and parts of equal weight and fineness to American dollar. This silver coinage would drive out both French half-crown, and British silver against which Lower Canadians complain. Banks are quite able to resume specie payments, but the effects would be as described. Bank notes of Lower Canada redeemable in French half-crowns would take place of Upper Canadian money. Among the circumstances making immediate resumption undesirable is embarrassed state of Provincial finances. Holders of Provincial debentures, in alarm, turn to Bank to redeem them at par on ground that they bought these debentures from Bank. Within last 6 months Bank has repurchased debentures to amount of Â£40,700. These are now unsaleable. To these are to be added Â£37,500 sterling of Provincial Debentures unsold and unsaleable in hands of their London agents. For all these reasons, Bank represents undesirability of immediate resumption of specie payments."],"tagDate":["1838-08-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagPlace":["Bank of Upper Canada, Toronto"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 3.

Consideration of Durham's despatch of August 16. Council observe that Durham conceives that his instructions impose upon him the duty of exercising the power of pardon in all cases of treason. Council maintain that there is no legal authority by which the Lieutenant Governor can divest himself of the responsibility and discretion required in acting according to the constitution of the province under the commission which, in the absence of His Lordship, Your Excellency executes. If Governor's view is correct, then the Council has been mistakenly advising on questions involving life and death of fellow subjects; and the fact that they had done so for so long, without remonstrance from Governor, does little to mitigate gravity of their course. Arthur's duty was to act as much as possible in conformity with views of Governor, and this he has striven to do, as far as his policy was understood. That the power of granting pardon was conferred on Arthur, in Durham's absence, is stated in precise terms, in Glenelg's despatch of July 12. Although Durham's high influence and authority may uphold Arthur's policy, the functions of Governor of the Colony remain to be discharged by Your Excellency according to your oath of office. Painful consequences if Durham took on himself to hear appeals from decisions of Lieutenant Governor. Appellate jurisdiction of this sort has been sedulously avoided by the Government in England. Lieutenant Governor has sought to carry out views of Durham, and it is remembered that on more than one occasion while in Upper Canada, Durham with reference to invasion of Upper Canada declared that summary and immediate execution might not improperly have been carried into effect instead of awaiting the deliberate course of proceeding. Popular feeling was gratified by these declarations and Council felt thereafter that Government was more likely to be charged with not acting up to extent of Durham's policy, than with exceeding it. Government are apparently not acting in accordance with Durham's declared policy, and popular mind is exasperated and impatient. State of feeling in United States, and its effect as regards necessary action in Upper Canada. Council fixed in opinion that prompt and exemplary punishment is necessary in case of late incursions, and would have recorded their conviction, had the point been raised, that, in the execution of Morreau, Arthur was acting in accordance with expressed views of Durham. After reciting facts in cases of Beamer, Chandler, Wait, McLeod, Brown and Warner: Council notes the care of militia to act always within the law. This was due to their confidence that prompt punishment would follow trial. If confidence destroyed, the militia would either relax in their zeal for the country's safety, or take law into their own hands and slay prisoners on the spot. Inviting attention to that part of Glenelg's despatch in which Arthur was authorized to relax the severity of sentence not as reversing wrong judgments, but as acting upon information which the Executive Council did not possess, and upon views to which the Legal Tribunals could not advert, and noting the opportunity this view gave the Lieutenant Governor to take advantage of any kindlier public sentiment that might manifest itself, the Council point out that appeals to the Governor General from the Lieutenant Governor's decisions would create impression that his decisions mere unnecessarily severe and impolitic, and thus extensions of mercy, which would tend to strengthen the Governor if granted by 'him, would undermine confidence in him if granted by Durham. The appearance of divided authority could scarcely fail to create in Province a Governor General's party and a Lieutenant Governor's party, with fatal results to authority of both. There is also danger of exciting resentment of those who believe that Constitutional Act of 1791 gave to Upper Canada an Executive Government, to whom they have access, and who, through medium of Home Government, are responsible for conduct of their affairs; also, want of confidence in Lieutenant Governor as it is observed that his powers under his commission, are unduly restricted.
