This sale was characterized by a scarcely imaginable recklessness of profusion in the alienation of Crown property, and by a deliberate and systematic violation of every regulation framed for the direction of the commissioner. Through every stage of the business there were the marks of duplicity and irregularity. The letter of the local agent requesting authority to make the sale was false in the impression it was designed to convey. It purports to have been written in New Carlisle, whereas it was written in the office and apparently at dictation of Mr. Felton, then Commissioner of Crown Lands at Quebec. The Commissioner then obtained authority from Gosford to sell 35,000 acres in Cox and Hamilton townships, and straightway ordered sale of over 100,000 acres. The price at which it was to be offered was less than one-third of what would have produced from timber licences in same area. Sale was not advertised. Sale was deficient in almost every requisite to validity, but it was by no means a solitary case of the same sort. Durham would have confirmed Gosford's refusal to ratify sale, had it not been that faith of Crown was pledged to any public proceeding of Commissioner. As purchasers were not shown to have been cognizant of irregularities, he had no course open but to confirm sale.

Durham takes the occasion to enunciate his political principles: I wish to rally as large a portion of the British people as possible, around the existing institutions of the country-the Throne-Lords-Commons-and The Established Church. I do not wish to make new institutions, but to preserve and strengthen the old. Herein lies the difference between me and my opponents. Some would confine the advantages of those institutions to as small a class as possible. I would throw them open to all who had the ability to comprehend them, and the vigor to protect them. Others again would annihilate them for the purpose of forming new ones on fanciful and untried principles. I would, I repeat, preserve them, but increase their efficiency and add to the number of their supporters. I have often stated the modes by which, as I imagine, that efficiency can be most readily produced, but I have ever accompanied those declarations, as I do now, with the announcement of my determination never to force them peremptorily or dogmatically on the consideration of the Government or the Parliament. If they are (as, in my conscience, I believe them to be) useful and salutary measures-for they are based on the most implicit loyalty and good feeling of the people-the course of events, and the experience of every day will remove the objections and prejudices, which may now exist, and ensure their adoption whenever they are recommended by the deliberate and determined voice of public opinion. It has been my ruling principle throughout my political life, to endeavor to bring all classes, especially the middle and lower, within the pale of the true, not the spurious, constitution. I have ever wished to give the latter an interest in the preservation privileges, which exclusion would no longer render obnoxious to them-to make them feel that whilst the Crown enjoyed its prerogatives, and the upper classes their honors, they also were invested with privileges most valuable to them, and, moreover, that all, separately and collectively, rested on the common basis of National utility."],"tagPerson":["Bowlby, Russell","Durham"],"tagDate":["1837-07-08T00:00:00.000Z"]},"726":{"tagPlace":["Blandford Street, Portman Square"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 6.
