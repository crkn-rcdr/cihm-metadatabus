Enclosing copy of opinion of Law Officers, on Ordinance for providing for the security of the Province of Lower Canada. In their opinion, only part legally objectionable is that relating to treatment of prisoners beyond limits of province. Weighty opinion in House of Lords held whole Ordinance as ultra vires, but this extreme view not sanctioned in either House. More serious popular objections raised against the part subjecting refugees returning without permission to capital punishment. Government recognizing Durham's difficulties would have been content to allow this to stand, feeling assured that no act of needless severity or substantial injustice would have had his sanction. Question taken out of hands of Government by bill introduced in Lords, to declare Special Council's powers to be so narrowly restricted that the Ordinance was quite ultra vires, and to provide indemnity for all acts done under it. In spite of opposition of Government, bill received second rending, and Government, in view of partial illegality of Ordinance, and consequent. difficulties in defending it, decided to advise disallowance. The bill was amended by omission of parts restricting powers of Special Council, and confining indemnity to acts done under admittedly illegal parts. The bill as amended passed both Houses. Government fears action of Parliament has enhanced Durham's difficulties, but, on other hand, the numerous strong expressions of confidence in Durham's administration, have strengthened his hands. Government determined in spite of disallowance that Bermuda exiles shall not return to Canada without permission. Suggests Ordinance subjecting exiles returning, to my punishment short of death and a proclamation that refugees returning will undergo trial for treason; also, continuance of suspension of Habeas Corpus. Indispensable that Suspension Act and Proclamation of disallowance be published simultaneously, to avoid unfairness to exiles or refugees. Government does not desire to fetter discretion of Durham in dealing with these matters; no course open to him free from objections. It is assumed that no action has been taken under Ordinance for attainder of persons indicted for treason and who have avoided trial. Matter within Durham's discretion. Object to be attained not so much severe punishment as exclusion of agitators from Province, and prevention of their interference in its affairs. Government deeply regretted embarrassment to which Durham has been subjected; and approved heartily of the spirit in which those measures were conceived, and were convinced that they were calculated under your authority to satisfy the ends of justice, although in some respects they involved a departure from its ordinary forms. Assurance given of undiminished confidence, and of earnest desire to afford him utmost support."],"tagPlace":["Downing Street"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 1.-LETTERS AND DESPATCHES TO LORD DURHAM FROM COLONIAL SECRETARY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Is, however, still of opinion that Beamer should have been executed. His reasons for considering Beamer's offence greater than the others. Recommendations of juries not given great weight by his council. Declares Durham misapprehended him in thinking that Chandler, Wait and Macleod should all have been executed. When Morreau was executed, it was determined that one more should be, Beamer was selected as being most deeply implicated. No material difference of opinion between them as to amnesty. The difference of opinion between masses of people in Upper and Lower Canada led him to extend mercy cautiously and progressively. In districts between Toronto and London, which he visited, general opinion was that Government had gone too far with pardons. He has however, continued the lenient course, with the result that there are few convicts awaiting final decision. Some of those who have escaped and been indicted, may he allowed to return. They should apply individually and promise to demean themselves loyalty before amnesty should be extended to them. For these reasons, he has issued proclamations calling upon these persons to submit to justice. Will on own responsibility extend amnesty in proper cases, provided Durham will concur in the immediate removal of the persons under sentence of transportation to whom further mercy ought not to be extended.

No authority found for Gosford's statement in despatch of April 26, 1837, and in message to Assembly of March 5, respecting promise of Prince Regent previous to 1819 to grant land to embodied militia who had served during late war. Has found that at conclusion of war, land was offered to an number of regular troops, to foreign regiments serving under de Meuron and de Watteville, and as condition of enlistment to Glengarry Fencibles and Canadian Voltigeurs; also, that Duke of Richmond in message to Assembly on April 3, 1819 stated that lands had been set apart for officers and men coming under spirit and meaning of Royal Instructions. But can find no such instructions. It would appear that some misapprehension exists, unless documents may be missing from files. The claim, however, has been recognized both by Imperial and Provincial Governments, and, however unfounded, cannot, he disregarded. Government's policy must be governed not by sentiment but by duty on-owed to public in administration of their lands, and, in absence of pledge to contrary course, cannot sanction a claim involving an improvident and uncompensated alienation of Crown Lands. Durham, unless possessing documentary evidence not on files, or moved by other considerations, is directed to inform claimants of decision to abide by terms of despatch of June 12, 1836 as interpreted by Gosford and himself viz.:-that none but those included in list of officers presented to Assembly on April 19, 1819, and who came within two first classes in Gosford's proposal can be allowed the benefit of it. In the case of all except those mentioned in despatch of June 12, 1836, forfeiture accruing from delay in obtaining Patents, should be enforced."],"tagDate":["1838-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagPerson":["Glenelg","Durham"],"tagPlace":["Downing Street"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 1.-LETTERS AND DESPATCHES TO LORD DURHAM FROM COLONIAL SECRETARY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Attention directed to despatches noted in margin as indicating general views and specific instructions given. Gosford's despatch (No. 71) of July 13, 1837, transmitting Report of Committee of Executive Council, reached him in September, but necessary delays and insurrectionary troubles prevented action until present Durham to realize the importance or subject. There is not one of graver importance in itself or involving obligations of a deeper or more enduring character Report of Committee of Executive Council leaves little to be desired. Durham authorized to carry proposals therein into effect. The recommendation regarding the substitution of European mode of dress for native costumes approved; to be carried into effect without violence to feeling to prejudices of people. Practice of giving trinkets as presents to be abandoned. Agricultural implements to be substituted. Desires to know if recommendations as to wandering Indians have been carried out, and if they have evinced any intention of settling. Objections to commuting presents for money decisive. Condition of education not creditable to British rule. Under French rule, this was carried on by Jesuit missionaries, a class of men of whom it must be admitted that, whatever may have been their delinquencies in the Old World, they have in the New been known chiefly as the protectors and civilizers' of a Race forsaken as trampled upon by all beside. Their example must be emulated. Durham to give attention to establishing schools for rudimentary education, combined with instruction in agriculture and some handicrafts Report of Committee encouraging as to possibility of civilizing Indians. Desires to learn of progress in Agricultural School and Farm of P. Christie, and whether reports have been made as to other suitable places for similar institutions. Agrees with conclusion of Committee as to desirability of compact settlements though liberty to be given to those preferring locations elsewhere. These latter to have presents in form of agricultural implements. Special attention invited to recommendations respecting separate tribes. This will be the easier, on account of Gosford's directions that tracts reserved for Indians or necessary as augmentations are not to be disposed of without express authority. Iroquois, Algonquin and Nipissing tribes, who are without land should have reserves assigned to them. Difficulty of question as to how reserves should be secured to Indians. Cultivation in Upper Canada somewhat retarded by want of legal title. Saleable titles objectionable as exposing Indians to frauds. As a solution, Arthur was directed, if insuperable objections did not appear, to cause title deeds to be drawn up and recorded in office of Commissioner of Crown Lands. where they might be seen by any person deputed thereto by Indians. If Indians desired to dispose of Indians, Government would consider their applications. Similar course suggested for Lower Canada Indians Lands. As regard Reserves, these must be inalienable except by consent of Executive, who should, also, be empowered, in event of non-cultivation, to remove them to remoter districts as settlement advances. Ii cultivated, reserves might be contracted to limits protruding means of procuring adequate and comfortable subsistence. Recommendation that garden lots be granted to Lorette Indians approved. Periodical reports on Condition of Indians required and any questions which may occur to Durham on improvement. Appalling statement of committee that the average number of children having does not exceed five for each four families while average among whites is four for each marriage. Urges fact on Durham as motive for special exertions on his part. In general, the concerns of the Indians must Contribute under care and superintendence of Crown, until circumstances make it expedient to turn them over to Provincial legislature. As regards money appreciated to Indian affairs, the Parliamentary grant should not, in general, be exceeded. But no real interest of Indians should be sacrificed or improvement deferred merely on ground of expense. Excess expenditure due to these causes might be drawn from Provincial Revenues, Including Crown Revenues Presents that in Proposals to Provincial Legislatures, for session of Crown Revenues for fixed Civil List, same Stipulation was not made on behalf of Indians, In cases like those of Upper and Lower Canada, where subject still open, some provision for Indians might be made.

In Lower Canada, the whole of the cases arising out of insurrection have been disposed of: goals emptied; punishments to be inflicted, allotted; no uncertainty of any sort remains. Effort should be made to reach same results in Upper Canada. There state of feeling enables enforcement of law by ordinary legal means. Severe example has been made of most notorious offenders. Excitement should be stopped by immediate trial of all others in custody, without infliction of further capital punishment, and amnesty to all except most prominent,.

As to Durham's statement that he knew that the section as to restraint of exiles in Bermuda was inoperative, and looked to Government to supply remedy, no hint of this view was contained in Durham's despatches, nor did he give Government opportunity, as prisoners were sent away a few days after ordinance issued. Government did indeed consider propriety of proposing a measure to supply the defect, but after full deliberation set aside the idea as inexpedient. Had hoped to have been able to remain silent on Turton's appointment, but Durham's allusion to it in despatch (No. 66) makes that impossible. Despatch (No. 30) was not answered because correspondence would have involved wide departure from ordinary rules of official communications; also, because it could not fail to cause needless pain to individual concerned. Durham is reminded that the selection of Turton as legal adviser was made without previous communication with either Melbourne or himself. and without knowledge of either; and that as soon as it became known, Melbourne stated his decided objection to it. Durham on Melbourne's remonstrance waived the appointment, but stated he would take Turton to Canada as his private friend. Both Melbourne and himself had firm impression that any assistance Turton might render to Durham would be given in private capacity only."],"tagDate":["1838-11-12T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagPerson":["Glenelg","Durham"],"tagPlace":["Downing"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 1.-LETTERS AND DESPATCHES TO LORD DURHAM FROM COLONIAL SECRETARY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.
