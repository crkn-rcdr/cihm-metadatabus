The King would no doubt, act with the same generosity towards the Jesuits of Canad: who were almost all in the decline of life, too old to be banished from their country and several not fit to provide for their own subsistence.

In 1679 all the islands on the coast within the described limits were granted to Joliet and Lalande. It is within these limits that Gros Mecatinat, claimed by Hocquart, is situated, containing, according to description, four leagues in front and four in depth, with all the isles and islets adjoining. The proprietors making no use of the post for a fishery, Hocquart in 1739, being then Intendant, granted a lease of it for nine years to Pomereau, but the post being a part of the seigniory of the Main Land and Isles of Mingan, three percent. of all the profits was reserved for the proprietors. Death of Pomereau, extension of the lease for three years to his widow, her refusal to pay an increased rent induced the proprietors to take it into their own hands, but Bigot, then Intendant, refused them possession, on the alleged ground of prejudicing the rights of the Crown. Tachet, employed by the proprietors, went to France and obtained for them the promise of the post, but Hocquart by his influence at the Court of France obtained a grant of Gros Mecatinat for life, on the reservation of three percent to the proprietors and leased it to Tachet, who held the post as lessee from Hocquart from 1754 to 1759, when the country was conquered. Cannot recommend that Hocquart be confirmed in possession of Gros Mecatina his title not warranting this, and may prejudice the claim of the grantees, which they wouId no doubt prosecute before the Courts in Quebec, should the coast of Labrador be reannexed to Quebec, having been improvidently made a part of the Government of Newfoundland by the proclamation of 1763.
