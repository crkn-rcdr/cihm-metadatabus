The attachment of Canadians generally to the Crown is proven by their repelling the attacks of invading armies, and in enduring tile indignities put upon them by a privileged class within the province. He makes the following suggestions for the restoration of contentment and tranquility: Endow Church of England, Church of Scotland, Methodists and other Protestant communities, from Clergy Reserve fund; confer no exclusive civil or ecclesiastical privileges on any denomination. Give equal rights to the Scotch in University and Upper Canada College. These Institutions were endowed by the misappropriation of 291,000 acres of land, which were designed by the Legislature in 1797 for endowment of Grammar Schools throughout province. Encourage immigration by low price of lands and the erection of mills. Most of latter are in hands of Americans who are disseminating views antagonistic to Empire. Abolish system of sale of lands to immigrants on credit. Bring out some thousands of Highlanders to serve as Fencibles for 2 or 3 years, granting them land as compensation.

The paper is a copy in the same hand as that of many other documents in the Durham Collection. Along with it is a summary, which includes some matter not in the original. As this summary has many marginal comments made by Durham, it is the paper from which the following digest is made). The object in view of the writer is the formation of a government for the British North American colonies, which will provide for the supremacy of the Mother Country as well as protect the common interests of all the colonies, present and future. The plan contemplates the immediate union of Upper and Lower Canada, and subsequently, at their option, the Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland. It is proposed to give (1) a Special Government for each province, which will have full control of its local affairs; (2) a General Government which will control all matters common to all or to two or more of the provinces; (3) a governor, appointed by the Crown, for each local government and for the General Government, with veto upon all legislative acts. Provincial Government. Administration to consist of Governor and Executive Council. The latter to consist of not less than 5 members. The salaries of Governor and Executive Council to be fixed by legislature, and to be subject to revision every 6 years. Legislature to consist of Governor, Executive Council and Assembly. The function of the Executive Council to be to revise or amend, but not absolutely reject, all bills sent up from the Assembly. The Assembly to have full control of Provincial Revenue, subject to Civil List being open to revision every 6 years. Elections to be triennial at fixed dates, and Legislature to assemble at fixed date every year. Provincial Legislatures shall possess all powers not expressly bestowed on General Government, and shall not be under control of latter. Judiciary. Judges to have fixed salaries, unchangeable within ten year periods; to retire at certain age, but eligible for reappointment by Assembly on message from Governor. To be removable on address, if concurred in by Governor. Judges and other Provincial Officers to be subject to impeachment by Local Assembly before General Assembly. Local and Circuit Courts to be established, the judges to be appointed either by inhabitants of district or by Crown, and be removable on petition of majority in district, where such judges function. General Government-to consist of Governor General appointed by Crown; Executive Council; Legislative Body and Judiciary. Governor General and Executive Council to have powers within the larger sphere, identical with those of the Governor and Executive Council of each of the provinces. The General Legislative Assembly to consist of ten members from each province elected by the Assemblies. Its functions to be the same as those of the Provincial Assemblies, with the additional duty of sitting as a Court of Impeachment of Provincial Officers and Judges on the prosecution of the Provincial Assemblies. General Government is not to possess any power not expressly conferred on it. It should have control of Militia; Currency and Banking; Internal and External Commerce; Boundary questions, whether Inter-Provincial or International; Customs duties; Bankruptcy and Insolvency; Transportation system whether Inter-Provincial or International; Post Office; Vice-Admiralty jurisdiction; administration of Crown Lands, so far as Crown would consent. General Judiciary to consist of Supreme Court of (say) four judges, and such other Courts as would be found requisite. The functions of Supreme Court to be to try disputes between provinces; conflicts of right between General and Provincial Government; appeals from provinces and several inferior Courts; piracy; treason; offences against laws or matters made subject to General Government. The Judges would also assist for matters of law in Impeachments before General Assembly. Durham criticized the plan freely. He objected-to abolition of Legislative Councils: to the limitation of the Executive Council to five, and to the final appointment of the members by Governor; to fixed periods for election and assembling of Legislatures; to ex officio members, although this is not specifically made part of the plan; to triennial parliaments, considering the existing period too short. Points to be carefully considered in this part of the plan were the devolution of control of whole revenue on Assemblies, and the distribution of powers and duties between the Provincial and General Legislatures. As to Judiciary, he considered judges' salaries should be permanent during term of office, and objected entirely to proposal of reappointment of judges, whose ages called for retirement. He disliked the scheme for impeachment preferring Legislative Council as Court, and saw no reason for circuit judges. All judges should, in his opinion, be appointed by Crown. As regards the Assembly of the General Government, he was convinced that the plan of election by Provincial Government was contrary to interests of people. The number of members should be from 45 to 60. Montreal, Quebec and Halifax should be congressional districts, returning two members each. Boundary questions are best determined by Queen and Privy Council. Post Office should be regulated throughout Empire by Parliament. Crown Lands-he doubts whether Crown would part with control over them. The General Judiciary would, he thought, consist of one judge, and he doubted the necessity for any other courts in this connection. He would not leave to Supreme Court settlement of disputes between provinces, as they could be best settled by joint from Legislature. Appeals from provinces should be heard by Legislative Council of Central Government with final recourse to Privy Council. Treason should be tired in province where it is alleged to have occurred."]},"506":{"tagDescription":["A.L.S.

There is nothing in the document to indicate by whom it was drawn. It contains several peculiar provisions of which the principal are the following:- The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, and of the Special Council of Lower Canada, with such others as might be appointed. Regarding Assembly, the electoral arrangements as regards the number of members and their constituencies were to be unchanged. Lower Canada was to have a number of members equal to that in Upper Canada. Governor was to fix electoral districts, 200 voters to be the minimum in each. There were a variety of property qualifications for electors. In constituencies returning 2 members, where there were as many as 200 electors qualifying on lands held by seignorial tenure, and 200 qualifying on lands held under free and common soccage, each group should elect one member. In an accompanying schedule it was reckoned that under this plan, British and French Canadians would each have 31 members. But in the next section of the bill, provision was made for exceptional treatment of the constituencies of the District of Montreal, on account of its having been, in a particular sense, the scene of the rebellion. Governor was given power to suspend the issue of a writ into any of the constituencies of this District, as he sum fit, and to issue, in substitution therefor, a writ into any other District. According to the schedule mentioned, the result would be the return of 41 British and 21 French Canadian members. Provision was made for the interfusion of each branch of Government and legislature by members of the other branches. Executive Council was to include, among other members, two each from Legislative Council and Assembly. In Assembly there were to be two members of Executive Council, and two from Legislative Council. For certain periods, measures relating exclusively to Upper Canada were subject to veto of Upper Canada members."]},"788":{"tagName":["Fraser, John, Lieutenant. 7th Batt.
