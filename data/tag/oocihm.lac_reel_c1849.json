Replying to request in despatch (No. 2) of January 24, for decision as to course to be adopted towards political prisoners charged with murder or high treason. Immediate amnesty and discharge of all prisoners, though easiest course, not recommended. Some prisoners should be brought to early trial. Noting opinion of Lower Canadian officers of the law, supported by Colborne, that impartial trial cannot be had before ordinary tribunals in political cases, and that trials should be held by Courts-Martial, Government cannot acquiesce, until failure of ordinary tribunals is established. Government glad to observe release of over two hundred prisoners. Expectation that careful scrutiny will show that other prisoners may be discharged. Number of prisoners should be reduced to those whose offences cannot be overlooked without danger to tranquility of Province. Even among those held for trial, there may be some who will plead guilty and be willing to withdraw from Province. These might be released on security given. In selecting cases for trial before ordinary tribunals, care should be taken to pick out those against whom evidence is clear, and who are not strongly supported by popular sympathy. If verdicts are rendered on evidence, the other cases may be proceeded with. If not, the others should be detained. Should the law as it stands sanction a special commission to all the judges of Supreme Courts of Province, that course should be adopted. If legal objections exist to this course, they should be removed by legislation. Change of venue not desirable, except perhaps from Montreal to Quebec. No trials must take place for murder. They should be postponed until public excitement has subsided. Should any capital convictions take place for political offences, they must be reserved for consideration of Durham."]},"47":{"tagPlace":["St. Hyacinthe"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 4.

Original grantees required on pain of forfeiture to settle lands with Protestants from Europe, (not part of British dominions), or by inhabitants, of at least two years' standing in British colonies in North America. For reasons then unascertainable, conditions remained largely ineffective. In 1802, a local Act was passed enforcing forfeiture, but it was not confirmed. In 1817, two estates, Lots 15 and 55, were re-invested in Crown, but in following year conditions mere made easier. In 1832, Legislature passed act for Court of Escheat, which was disallowed. Owing to misapprehension of conditions of Island, the terms of grants could not be fulfilled for reasons mentioned. Forfeiture could not be sanctioned unless Government were satisfied of neglect of proprietors. Government cannot therefore accede to prayer of Assembly. Attention invited to measure in Upper Canada, imposing tax on all granted lands, and when taxes were eight years in arrears, directing sale of lands sufficient to cover arrears. Suggested that Prince Edward Island might try similar plan, but act for that purpose should contain clause for suspension until His Majesty's pleasures should be declared.

Exposing the situation as regards the Clergy Reserves question. Quotation of clauses 36-42 of Constitutional Act of 1791. Land held as Clergy Reserves in Upper Canada, 2,254,668 acres; in Lower Canada, 919.013 acres. Lands for many years practically unsaleable, and an obstacle in way of rising settlements. Act 7 and 8 George IV. c. 62 provided for sale of part of lands, the interest on proceeds to be applied either to improvement of remaining Reserve Lands or to purposes indicated in Constitutional Act. Amount then invested £79,920-15-10 for Upper Canada, and £31,085-2-7 for Lower Canada. Doubts as to beneficiaries. First interpretation of Act identified Protestant Clergy with clergy of Church of England. In 1819, Law Officers of Crown gave opinion that Church of Scotland was entitled equally with Church of England, but no other Protestant bodies. This view sanctioned by committee of House of Commons in 1828. After 1829, when revenues became considerable. Church of Scotland pressed claims, but Church of England contained to resist them, while other Protestant bodies, insisting on their right, demanded modification of Act. Lord Ripon in 1831 recommended the Provincial Legislatures to pass acts re-investing the Reserves in Crown. Suggestion not adopted by either Legislature. Objections to Imperial Parliament dealing with subject specially delegated by Constitutional Act to Provincial Legislatures. In meantime whole proceeds in Upper Canada have gone to Church of England, and £1,350 have been paid to Church of Scotland from Casual and Territorial Revenue. In Lower Canada £500 paid to Church of Scotland from revenue of Reserves. The arrangement as regards Upper Canada rests on guarantee given in 1834 on reduction of vote to S. P. G. that salaries of English Church clergy should be provided from local revenues. Being insufficient, the excess was thrown on Casual and Territorial Revenue. Amount paid from Casual and Territorial Revenue for 1836 was £2,565. General dissatisfaction expressed with arrangement. Government anxious to law question settled.

Gosford and predecessors in government of Lower Canada were given commissions for government of each and all provinces. In each of other provinces, the Governor's commission was administered by a Lieutenant Governor, who corresponded directly with Secretary of State. The distinction therefore was merely titular. If Governor had resorted in person to any of other provinces, the Lieutenant Governor's office and authority would have been suspended during continuance of Governor in that province. The Governor was therefore interdicted from going beyond limits of Lower Canada. Though there are fire provinces, there are only three commissions: one for two Canada's, one for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and one for New Brunswick. The reason would seem to be to save fees at Patent Office. The inconvenience is that the commissions respecting Upper Canada and Prince Edward Island mere not accessible in those provinces. The best mode of preparing the commissions would seem to be as follows: First, a distinct commission to Durham as Governor of each province. These might be deposited at the respective provincial capitals. Second, a sixth commission would constitute Durham Governor General, Captain General and Lord High Commissioner throughout British North America. This he would retain, and it would accompany him wherever he had occasion to repair. The ordinary commission would authorize Durham and the several Lieutenant Governors to conduct apart from each other the common duties of the Government. The extraordinary commission would require the Lieutenant Governors to execute their powers under instructions of the Governor General. The advantage of this mode is that when Durham's functions as Governor General and High Commissioner cease, the particular commission may be revoked, and the others remain undisturbed."],"tagDate":["1838-01-20T00:00:00.000Z"],"tagNotebook":["THE DURHAM PAPERS SESSIONAL PAPER No. 23 SECTION 1.-LETTERS AND DESPATCHES TO LORD DURHAM FROM COLONIAL SECRETARY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Despite many advantages, Canadians are humiliatingly inferior industrially to those on the other side of border line. Position due to system of government. The causes of the prolonged mismanagement may be traced to the fact, that all who have access to the Ministers of the Crown, and on whose counsels the Executive Government is compelled to depend are in one way or other connected with the promoters and upholders of that baneful system. Every dweller in Upper Canada convinced that his property would be of double its present value if it was separated from British jurisdiction. Loyalty of present inhabitants will diminish with each succeeding generation. Party exists in each province which has managed to absorb all places of profit and influence, and who distribute all patronage. If they acted less selfishly and more patriotically not a bayonet would be required to maintain Government. They are open in opposition to and indecent in denunciation of Ministers of Crown. Evils of dominant Church, attended by only fraction of population. Arthur has disappointed friends of permanent tranquility. Denunciations of Gosford by upholders of system. Violence of this party against clemency of British Government towards misguided men.
