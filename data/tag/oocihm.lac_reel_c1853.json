The information was imparted to him by Benjamin Ogden, an eminent lawyer and for many years a leader of the Whig party, for the purpose of transmission to Durham. Mr. Ogden was about to notify the Government in Washington, and assured him that, though opposed to it, he was convinced of the Government's good faith towards Great Britain and of its sincere desire to preserve peace between the two countries. Young, also, relates that the Mayor of New York told him that Papineau had lately visited him and expressed surprise at the inaction of Americans over burning of Caroline. The Mayor stated they were satisfied to leave matters in hand of Government at Washington, and, on Papineau's intimating that he intended to discuss the matter, the Mayor said that if he attempted any public agitation, he would put it down and Papineau along with it."
