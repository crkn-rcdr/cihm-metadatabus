# CIHM-METS
Perl module for processing Canadiana METS records

Not much written about module yet. This is based on some internal functionalty with history, and is being made available on GitHub.

Used by the metadata bus to read METS records within an AIP in the TDR, and return the perl HASH that will be posted to CouchDB and Solr for the front-end interface (currently CAP).

Please [read the history](HISTORY.md) for more context.
