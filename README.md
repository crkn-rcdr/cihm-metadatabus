# cihm-metadatabus

Docker build environment and libraries for key portions of the metadata bus.

See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) for where to find some of the history of the libraries.

See CIHM-Meta subdirectory for the code that does most of the work.  Other libraries and submodules are support for that primary submodule.
